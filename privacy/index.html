However, despite our safeguards and efforts to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be 100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers, cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect your personal information, transmission of personal information to and from our Website is at your own risk. You should only access the Website within a secure environment.</p>

    <div class="info-data" id="google8">
        <h4>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h4>
        <p>Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of this privacy notice. </p>

        <p>California Civil Code Section 1798.83, also known as the "Shine The Light" law, permits our users who are California residents to request and obtain from us, once a year and free of charge, information about categories of personal information (if any) we disclosed to third parties for direct marketing purposes and the names and addresses of all third parties with which we shared personal information in the immediately preceding calendar year. If you are a California resident and would like to make such a request, please submit your request in writing to us using the contact information provided below.</p>
        <p>If you are under 18 years of age, reside in California, and have a registered account with the Website, you have the right to request removal of unwanted data that you publicly post on the Website. To request removal of such data, please contact us using the contact information provided below, and include the email address associated with your account and a statement that you reside in California. We will make sure the data is not publicly displayed on the Website, but please be aware that the data may not be completely or comprehensively removed from all our systems (e.g. backups, etc.).</p>

        <p>(2) every individual who is domiciled in the State of California who is outside the State of California for a temporary or transitory purpose</p>
        </div>
        <p>All other individuals are defined as "non-residents."</p>

        <p>More information about our data collection and sharing practices can be found in this privacy notice.</p>
        <p>You may contact us by visiting familylaw-sd.com/contact, or by referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document.</p>
        <p>If you are using an authorized agent to exercise your right to opt-out we may deny a request if the authorized agent does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf.</p>
        <p>Will your information be shared with anyone else?</p>
        <p>We may disclose your personal information with our service providers pursuant to a written contract between us and each service provider. Each service provider is a for-profit entity that processes the information on our behalf.</p>
        <p>We may use your personal information for our own business purposes, such as for undertaking internal research for technological development and demonstration. This is not considered to be "selling" of your personal data.</p>
        <p> We have not disclosed or sold any personal information to third parties for a business or commercial purpose in the preceding 12 months. We will not sell personal information in the future belonging to website visitors, users and other consumers.</p>
        <p>Your rights with respect to your personal data</p>
        <p>Right to request deletion of the data - Request to delete</p>
        <p>You can ask for the deletion of your personal information. If you ask us to delete your personal information, we will respect your request and delete your personal information, subject to certain exceptions provided by law, such as (but not limited to) the exercise by another consumer of his or her right to free speech, our compliance requirements resulting from a legal obligation or any processing that may be required to protect against illegal activities.</p>
        <p>Right to be informed - Request to know</p>
        <div>
            <p>Depending on the circumstances, you have a right to know:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>whether we collect and use your personal information;</li>
            <li>the categories of personal information that we collect;</li>
            <li>the purposes for which the collected personal information is used;</li>
            <li>whether we sell your personal information to third parties;</li>
            <li>the categories of personal information that we sold or disclosed for a business purpose;</li>
            <li>the categories of third parties to whom the personal information was sold or disclosed for a business purpose; and</li>
            <li>the business or commercial purpose for collecting or selling personal information.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In accordance with applicable law, we are not obligated to provide or delete consumer information that is de-identified in response to a consumer request or to re-identify individual data to verify a consumer request.</p>
        </div>
        <p>Right to Non-Discrimination for the Exercise of a Consumer’s Privacy Rights</p>
        <p>We will not discriminate against you if you exercise your privacy rights.</p>
        <p>Verification process</p>
        <p>Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to determine you are the same person about whom we have the information in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to provide information so that we can match it with information you have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so that we can match the information you provide with the information we already have on file, or we may contact you through a communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the circumstances dictate.</p>
        <p>We will only use personal information provided in your request to verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you for the purposes of verification. If, however, we cannot verify your identity from the information already maintained by us, we may request that you provide additional information for the purposes of verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as soon as we finish verifying you.</p>
        <div>
            <p>Other privacy rights</p>
            <ul>
            <li>you may object to the processing of your personal data.</li>
            <li>you may request correction of your personal data if it is incorrect or no longer relevant, or ask to restrict the processing of the data.</li>
            <li>you can designate an authorized agent to make a request under the CCPA on your behalf. We may deny a request from an authorized agent that does not submit proof that they have been validly authorized to act on your behalf in accordance with the CCPA.</li>
            <li>you may request to opt-out from future selling of your personal information to third parties. Upon receiving a request to opt-out, we will act upon the request as soon as feasibly possible, but no later than 15 days from the date of the request submission.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>To exercise these rights, you can contact us by visiting familylaw-sd.com/contact, or by referring to the contact details at the bottom of this document. If you have a complaint about how we handle your data, we would like to hear from you.</p>
